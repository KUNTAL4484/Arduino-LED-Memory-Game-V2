# Arduino-LED-Memory-Game-V2
This is a small Arduino based LED memory game. When you will power the game, the LED's' will glow up at a random sequence. Every time you press the right LED button in the right sequence, the game will continue. Otherwise, this will disqualify you. After pushing a button or after the sequence complete, you have three seconds to press the button. If at that time, you are unable, also you will disqualify. Every time after a new LED glow up, the speed of the LED glow up will automatically increase. This game has ended on level 13, i.e max 13 LED's' glow up. If you can beat that, you will be the mastermind of this game.
